Common browsers are for example Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text-files in your browser. These files are called cookies.</p> <p>What should not be dismissed, is that cookies are very useful little helpers. Nearly all websites use cookies. More accurately speaking these are HTTP-cookies, since there are also different cookies for other uses. http-cookies are small files which our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are automatically put into the cookie-folder, which is like the &quot;brain&quot; of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. Moreover, to define a cookie, one or multiple attributes must be specified.</p> <p>Cookies save certain parts of your user data, such as e.g. language or personal page settings. When you re-open our website, your browser submits these &quot;user specific&quot; information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are familiar to. In some browsers every cookie has its own file, in others such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.</p> <p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party coookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, while third-party cookies are created by partner-websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Every cookie is individual, since every cookie stores different data. The expiration time of a cookie also varies &mdash; it can be a few minutes, or up to a few years. Cookies are no software-programs and contain no computer viruses, trojans or any other malware. Cookies also cannot access your PC's information.</p> <p>This is an example of how cookie-files can look:</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">name:</strong> _ga<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152121360119-9<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">purpose:</strong> differentiation between website visitors<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">expiration date:</strong> after 2 years</p> <p>A browser should support these minimum sizes:</p> <ul class="adsimple-121360119"> <li class="adsimple-121360119">at least 4096 bytes per cookie</li> <li class="adsimple-121360119">at least 50 cookies per domain</li> <li class="adsimple-121360119">at least 3000 cookies in total</li> </ul> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">Which types of cookies are there?</h3> <p>What exact cookies we use, depends on the used services. We will explain this in the following sections of the Privacy Policy statement. Firstly, we will briefly focus on the different types of HTTP-cookies.</p> <p>There are 4 different types of cookies:</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">Essential Cookies<br /> </strong>These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic function of a website. They are needed when a user for example puts a product into their shopping cart, then continues surfing on different websites and comes back later in order to proceed to the checkout. Even when the user closed their window priorly, these cookies ensure that the shopping cart does not get deleted.</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">Purposive Cookies<br /> </strong>These cookies collect info about the user behaviour and record if the user potentially receives any error messages. Furthermore, these cookies record the website's loading time as well as its behaviour within different browsers.</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">Target-orientated Cookies<br /> </strong>These cookies care for an improved user-friendliness. Thus, information such as previously entered locations, fonts or data in forms stay saved.</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">Advertising Cookies<br /> </strong>These cookies are also known as targeting-Cookies. They serve the purpose of delivering individually adapted advertisements to the user. This can be very practical, but also rather annoying.</p> <p>Upon your first visit to a website you are usually asked which of these cookie-types you want to accept. Furthermore, this decision will of course also be saved in a cookie.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">How can I delete cookies?</h3> <p>You yourself take the decision if and how you want to use cookies. Thus, no matter what service or website cookies are from, you always have the option to delete, deactivate or only partially allow them. Therefore, you can for example block cookies of third parties but allow any other cookies.</p> <p>If you want change or delete cookie-settings and would like to determine which cookies have been saved to your browser, you can find this info in your browser-settings:</p> <p> <a class="adsimple-121360119" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?tid=121360119" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in Chrome </a> </p> <p> <a class="adsimple-121360119" href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac?tid=121360119" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Safari: Manage cookies and website data in Safari </a> </p> <p> <a class="adsimple-121360119" href=" https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox?tid=121360119" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Firefox: Clear cookies and site data in Firefox </a> </p> <p> <a class="adsimple-121360119" href=" https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies?tid=121360119" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies </a> </p> <p> <a class="adsimple-121360119" href=" https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4027947/microsoft-edge-delete-cookies?tid=121360119" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Microsoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft Edge </a> </p> <p>If you generally do not want to allow any cookies at all, you can set up your browser in a way, to notify you whenever a potential cookie is about to be set. This gives you the opportunity to manually decide to either permit or deny the placement of every single cookie. The settings for this differ from browser to browser. Therefore, it might be best for you to search for the instructions in Google. If you are using Chrome, you could for example put the search phrase &quot;delete cookies Chrome&quot; or &quot;deactivate cookies Chrome&quot; into Google.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">How is my data protected?</h3> <p>There is a &quot;cookie policy&quot; that has been in place since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies requires the user's consent. However, among the countries of the EU, these guidelines are often met with mixed reactions. In Austria the guidelines have been implemented in &sect; 96 section 3 of the Telecommunications Act (TKG).</p> <p>If you want to learn more about cookies and do not mind technical documentation, we recommend <a class="adsimple-121360119" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265</a>, the Request for Comments of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called &quot;HTTP State Management Mechanism&quot;.</p> <h2 id="speicherung-persoenlicher-daten-en" class="adsimple-121360119">Storage of Personal Data</h2> <p>Any personal data you electronically submit to us on this website, such as your name, email address, home address or other personal information you provide via the transmission of a form or via any comments to the blog, are solely used for the specified purpose and get stored securely along with the respective submission times and IP-address. These data do not get passed on to third parties.</p> <p>Therefore, we use personal data for the communication with only those users, who have explicitly requested being contacted, as well as for the execution of the services and products offered on this website. We do not pass your personal data to others without your approval, but we cannot exclude the possibility this data will be looked at in case of illegal conduct.</p> <p>If you send us personal data via email &mdash; and thus not via this website &mdash; we cannot guarantee any safe transmission or protection of your data. We recommend you, to never send confidential data via email.</p> <h2 id="rechte-dsgvo-en" class="adsimple-121360119">Rights in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation</h2> <p>You are granted the following rights in accordance with the provisions of the <a class="adsimple-121360119" href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDPR</a> (General Data Protection Regulation) and the Austrian <a class="adsimple-121360119" href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1999_1_165/ERV_1999_1_165.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Protection Act (DSG)</a>:</p> <ul class="adsimple-121360119"> <li class="adsimple-121360119">right to rectification (article 16 GDPR)</li> <li class="adsimple-121360119">right to erasure (&quot;right to be forgotten&quot;) (article 17 GDPR)</li> <li class="adsimple-121360119">right to restrict processing (article 18 GDPR)</li> <li class="adsimple-121360119">righ to notification &mdash; notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing (article 19 GDPR)</li> <li class="adsimple-121360119">right to data portability (article 20 GDPR)</li> <li class="adsimple-121360119">Right to object (article 21 GDPR)</li> <li class="adsimple-121360119">right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing &mdash; including profiling &mdash; (article 22 GDPR)</li> </ul> <p>If you think that the processing of your data violates the data protection law, or that your data protection rights have been infringed in any other way, you can lodge a complaint with your respective regulatory authority.

With the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is an encryption protocol for safe data transfer on the internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential information. You can recognise the use of this safeguarding tool by the little lock-symbol, which is situated in your browser's top left corner, as well as by the use of the letters https (instead of http) as a part of our web address.</p> <h2 id="google-adsense-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121360119">Google AdSense Privacy Policy</h2> <p>We use Google AdSense on this website. It is an advertising program of the company Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). With Google AdSense we can show advertisements that fit our theme. Thus, we can offer you adverts that ideally give you added value. In this privacy statement on Google AdSense we will explain to you, why we use Google AdSense on our website and which of your data is processed and saved, as well as how you can prevent this data retention.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">What is Google AdSense?</h3> <p>The advertising program Google AdSense has been around since 2003. As opposed to Google Ads (previously: Google AdWords) it is not possible to advertise on Google AdSense oneself. Google AdSense displays advertisements on websites, such as ours. The biggest advantage of this web service compared to some others, is that Google AdSense only shows ads to you which match our website's contents. Google has its own algorithm which calculates what ads are shown to you. Of course, we only want to show you ads that interest you and provide you added value. Google checks which advertisements are suitable for our users, considering your interests, your user behaviour and our offer. At this point we want to mention that we are not responsible for the choice of the ads. We merely offer advertising space on our website, while Google selects the displayed ads. Moreover, since August 2013 the ads are customised to the respective user interface. This means, that no matter if you visit our website with your smartphone, your PC or your laptop, the ads adjust to your terminal device.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">Why do we use Google AdSense on our website?</h3> <p>The operation of a high-quality website requires tremendous dedication and commitment. We are essentially never finished with working on our website. This is, because we continuously maintain and keep our website up to date. Of course, we want to achieve economic success with this work. Therefore, we decided for to use advertisements as a source of revenue. It is most important to us however, that we do not disrupt your visit to our website with these advertisements. Thence, with the aid of Google AdSense, only adverts that are tailored to you and our themes are shown.</p> <p>Like with Google's indexation for a website, a bot examines both, the matching content and the offers on our website. Then, the ads are adapted to and presented on the website. Alongside the contextual overlaps between the ads and website offer, AdSense also supports interest-based targeting. This means, that Google also uses your data to offer advertising that is tailored to you. That way you receive ads that ideally offer you added value, and it gives us a higher chance of earning a bit.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">What data is stored by Google AdSense?</h3> <p>Google AdSense uses cookies to display ads that are customised to you. Cookies are little text files, that store certain information on your computer.</p> <p>Cookies are supposed to enable improved advertisements in AdSense. They do not contain any personally identifiable data. However, it should be considered that Google does not view data such as &quot;Pseudonymous Cookie-IDs&quot; (name or other identification feature is replaced with a pseudonym) or IP addresses as personally identifiable information. Although, within the framework of the GDPR, this data can be classified as personal data. Following every impression (every time you see an ad), every click and any other activity that leads to a call on its servers, Google AdSense sends a cookie to the browser. The cookie is then saved in the browser, provided the browser accepts it.</p> <p>Under certain circumstances, third parties can place cookies in your browser, and read them or use web beacons, to store data they receive through the display of ads on the website. Web beacons are little graphics that analyse and a record the log file. This analysis allows a statistical evaluation for the online marketing.</p> <p>Through this cookie, Google can collect certain information on your user behaviour on our website. These include:</p> <ul class="adsimple-121360119"> <li class="adsimple-121360119">Information on how you interact with an ad (clicks, impressions, mouse movements)</li> <li class="adsimple-121360119">Information if an ad has already been displayed in your browser. This data helps to prevent an ad from showing multiple times.</li> </ul> <p>Thereby, Google evaluates and analyses data on the displayed advertising material along with your IP address. Primarily, Google uses the data to measure the effectiveness of an ad and improve the advertising offer. Moreover, the data does not get linked to your personal data which Google might have received via other Google services.</p> <p>In the following we will introduce you to the cookies that Google AdSense uses for tracking purposes. Please note, that we will refer to a test website, which only has Google AdSense installed to it:</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">Name:</strong> uid<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">Value:</strong> 891269189121360119-8<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">Purpose:</strong> The cookie is stored under the domain adform.net.

Instagram is a social media platform of the company Instagram LLC, 1601 Willow Rd, Menlo Park CA 94025, USA. Since 2012, Instagram is a subsidiary company of Facebook Inc. and is a part of Facebook's products. The inclusion of Instagram's contents on our website is called embedding. With this, we can show you Instagram contents such as buttons, photos or videos directly on our website. If you open websites of our online presence, that have an integrated Instagram function, data gets transmitted to, as well as stored and processed by Instagram. Instagram uses the same systems and technologies as Facebook. Therefore, your data will be processed across all Facebook firms.</p> <p>In the following, we want to give you a more detailed insight on why Instagram collects data, what data these are and how you can control data processing. As Instagram belongs to Facebook Inc., we have, on the one hand received this information from the Instagram guidelines, and on the other hand from Facebook's Data Policy.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">What is Instagram?</h3> <p>Instagram is one of the most famous social media networks worldwide. Instagram combines the benefits of a blog with the benefits of audio-visual platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo. To &quot;Insta&quot; (how the platform is casually called by many users) you can upload photos and short videos, edit them with different filters and also share them to other social networks. Also, if you do not want to be active on Instagram yourself, you can just follow other interesting users.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">Why do we use Instagram on our website?</h3> <p>Instagram is a social media platform whose success has skyrocketed within recent years. Naturally, we have also reacted to this boom. We want you to feel as comfortable as possible on our website. Therefore, we attach great importance to diversified contents. With the embedded Instagram features we can enrich our content with helpful, funny or exciting Instagram contents. Since Instagram is a subsidiary company of Facebook, the collected data can also serve us for customised advertising on Facebook. Hence, only persons who are genuinely interested in our products or services can see our ads.</p> <p>Instagram also uses the collected data for tracking and analysis purposes. We receive summarised statistics and therefore more insight to your wishes and interests. It is important to mention that these reports do not identify you personally.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">What data is saved by Instagram?</h3> <p>Whenever you land on one of our sites, which have Instagram functions (i.e. Instagram photos or plugins) integrated to them, your browser automatically connects with Instagram's servers. Thereby, data is sent to, as well as saved and processed by Instagram. This always happens, whether you have an Instagram account or not. Moreover, it includes information on our website, your computer, your purchases, the advertisements you see and on how you use our offer. The date and time of your interaction is also stored. If you have an Instagram account or are logged in, Instagram saves significantly more data on you.</p> <p>Facebook distinguishes between customer data and event data. We assume this is also the case for Instagram. Customer data are for example names, addresses, phone numbers and IP addresses. These data are only transmitted to Instagram, if they have been &quot;hashed&quot; first. Thereby, a set of data is transformed into a string of characters, which encrypts any contact data. Moreover, the aforementioned &quot;event data&quot; (data on your user behaviour) is transmitted as well. It is also possible, that contact data may get combined with event data. The collected data data is matched with any data Instagram already has on you.</p> <p>Furthermore, the gathered data are transferred to Facebook via little text files (cookies) which usually get set in your browser. Depending on the Instagram function used, and whether you have an Instagram account yourself, the amount of data that gets stored varies.</p> <p>We assume data processing on Instagram works the same way as on Facebook. Therefore, if you have an account on Instagram or have visited <a class="adsimple-121360119" href="http://www.instagram.com?tid=121360119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.instagram.com</a>, Instagram has set at least one cookie. If this is the case, your browser uses the cookie to send information to Instagram, as soon as you come across an Instagram function. No later than 90 days (after matching) the data is deleted or anonymised. Even though we have studied Instagram's data processing in-depth, we cannot tell for sure what exact data Instagram collects and retains.</p> <p>In the following we will show you a list of the least cookies placed in your browser when click on an Instagram function (e.g. button or an Insta picture). In our test we assume you do not have an Instagram account, since if you would be logged in to your Instagram account, your browser would place significantly more cookies.<br /> The following cookies were used in our test:</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">Name: </strong>csrftoken<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">Value: </strong>&quot;&quot;<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121360119"> Purpose: </strong>This cookie is most likely set for security reasons to prevent falsifications of requests.

To do this, we use Google reCAPTCHA from Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheater Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). With reCAPTCHA we can determine whether you are a real person from flesh and bones, and not a robot or a spam software. By spam we mean any electronically undesirable information we receive involuntarily. Classic CAPTCHAS usually needed you to solve text or picture puzzles to check. But thanks to Google's reCAPTCHA you usually do have to do such puzzles. Most of the times it is enough to simply tick a box and confirm you are not a bot. With the new Invisible reCAPTCHA version you don't even have to tick a box. In this privacy policy you will find out how exactly this works, and what data is used for it.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">What is reCAPTCHA?</h3> <p>reCAPTCHA is a free captcha service from Google that protects websites from spam software and misuse by non-human visitors. This service is used the most when you fill out forms on the Internet. A captcha service is a type of automatic Turing-test that is designed to ensure specific actions on the Internet are done by human beings and not bots. During the classic Turing-test (named after computer scientist Alan Turing), a person differentiates between bot and human. With Captchas, a computer or software program does the same. Classic captchas function with small tasks that are easy to solve for humans but provide considerable difficulties to machines. With reCAPTCHA, you no longer must actively solve puzzles. The tool uses modern risk techniques to distinguish people from bots. The only thing you must do there, is to tick the text field &quot;I am not a robot&quot;. However, with Invisible reCAPTCHA even that is no longer necessary. reCAPTCHA, integrates a JavaScript element into the source text, after which the tool then runs in the background and analyses your user behaviour. The software calculates a so-called captcha score from your user actions. Google uses this score to calculate the likelihood of you being a human, before entering the captcha. reCAPTCHA and Captchas in general are used every time bots could manipulate or misuse certain actions (such as registrations, surveys, etc.).</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">Why do we use reCAPTCHA on our website?</h3> <p>We only want to welcome people from flesh and bones on our side and want bots or spam software of all kinds to stay away. Therefore, we are doing everything we can to stay protected and to offer you the highest possible user friendliness. For this reason, we use Google reCAPTCHA from Google. Thus, we can be pretty sure that we will remain a &quot;bot-free&quot; website. Using reCAPTCHA, data is transmitted to Google to determine whether you genuinely are human. reCAPTCHA thus ensures our website's and subsequently your security. Without reCAPTCHA it could e.g. happen that a bot would register as many email addresses as possible when registering, in order to subsequently &quot;spam&quot; forums or blogs with unwanted advertising content. With reCAPTCHA we can avoid such bot attacks.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">What data is stored by reCAPTCHA?</h3> <p>reCAPTCHA collects personal user data to determine whether the actions on our website are made by people. Thus, IP addresses and other data Google needs for its reCAPTCHA service, may be sent to Google. Within member states of the European Economic Area, IP addresses are almost always compressed before the data makes its way to a server in the USA.<br /> Moreover, your IP address will not be combined with any other of Google's data, unless you are logged into your Google account while using reCAPTCHA. Firstly, the reCAPTCHA algorithm checks whether Google cookies from other Google services (YouTube, Gmail, etc.) have already been placed in your browser. Then reCAPTCHA sets an additional cookie in your browser and takes a snapshot of your browser window.</p> <p>The following list of collected browser and user data is not exhaustive. Rather, it provides examples of data, which to our knowledge, is processed by Google.</p> <ul class="adsimple-121360119"> <li class="adsimple-121360119">Referrer URL (the address of the page the visitor has come from)</li> <li class="adsimple-121360119">IP-address (z.B. 256.123.123.1)</li> <li class="adsimple-121360119">Information on the operating system (the software that enables the operation of your computers.

JavaScript objects can collect all kinds of data under one name)</li> <li class="adsimple-121360119">Screen resolution (shows how many pixels the image display consists of)</li> </ul> <p>Google may use and analyse this data even before you click on the &quot;I am not a robot&quot; checkmark. In the Invisible reCAPTCHA version, there is no need to even tick at all, as the entire recognition process runs in the background. Moreover, Google have not given details on what information and how much data they retain.</p> <p>The following cookies are used by reCAPTCHA: With the following list we are referring to Google's reCAPTCHA demo version at <a class="adsimple-121360119" href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo</a>.<br /> For tracking purposes, all these cookies require a unique identifier.

A good, basic overview of the use of data however, can be found in the company's internal privacy policy at <a class="adsimple-121360119" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB&tid=121360119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB</a>.</p> <h2 id="benutzerdefinierte-google-suche-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121360119">Google Custom Search Privacy Policy</h2> <p>We integrated Google's custom search plug-in to our website. Google is the largest and most widely known search engine in the world and is operated by the American company Google LLC (1600 Amphitheater Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). Through Google Custom Search data can be transferred from you to Google. In this privacy policy we will inform you on why we use this plug-in, which data is processed and how you can manage or prevent the transmission of your data.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">What is Google Custom Search?</h3> <p>Google's Custom Search plug-in is a Google search bar that is integrated directly into our website. With it, searches take place just like on <a class="adsimple-121360119" href="https://www.google.com?tid=121360119" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">www.google.com</a>, but the search results focus on our content and products or a limited area.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">Why do we use Google Custom Search on our website?</h3> <p>A website with much interesting content often grows so big that it is easy to lose track. Over time, lots of valuable material has accumulated also on our site. But as part of our service we want you to be able to find our content in a quick and simple manner. Therefore, we have integrated Google Custom Search, which makes finding interesting content a breeze. Moreover, the built-in Google plug-in improves our website's overall quality and makes searches easier for you.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">What data does Google Custom Search store?</h3> <p>The customised Google search only transfers your data to Google, if you actively use the Google search function that is integrated to our website. This means that only when you type a search term in the search bar and click on &quot;Search&quot; or &quot;Enter&quot;, the search term is sent to Google along with your IP address, where they are stored and processed. Based on the placed cookies (such as 1P_JAR), Google may also receive data on website use. If you search for content via the built-in Google search function on our website, while you are logged into your Google account, Google can assign the collected data to your Google account. As the website operator, we have no influence on what Google do with the collected data or how Google process this data.</p> <p>The following cookies are set in your browser if you use Google Custom Search and are not logged into a Google account:</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">Name:</strong> 1P_JAR<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">Value:</strong> 2020-01-27-13121360119-5<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121360119">Purpose:</strong> This cookie collects website usage statistics and measures conversions.

This means the data can be accessed quicker and is better protected against potential manipulation. Google also have special emergency programs for your data. In case e.g. internal technical problems occur and some servers would stop working, the risk of an interruption of service and data loss remains low.<br /> Google store data for different lengths of time, depending on what type of data they are. You can delete some data yourself, while others are automatically deleted or anonymised by Google. However, Google stores certain data for longer if it is necessary for legal or business reasons.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121360119">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3> <p>According to the European Union's data protection regulations, you have the right to access information about your data as well as to update, delete or to restrict it.
